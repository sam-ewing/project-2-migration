The Haversine library is used to identify the closest border port to each incident and saved for plotting purposes. Once the datasets are refined, they are broken down into smaller datasets that can be joined or merged in a SQL database. These smaller datasets are output by Pandas as .csv files for loading into PostgreSQL.</p>

                      <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">In order to make sure our data is accessible through the web, we created an application that hosts data APIs for our front-end visualizations to consume.</p>

                        <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">To create our API, we had to use Python in order to query the PostgreSQL database created in the previous step. We used an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) called psycopg2 in order to do this.</p> 
                        <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">To stage our Postgres data, we created two denormalized tables that joined essential information about border ports and migrant incidents. Despite having originally converted our data to the Third Normal-Form (3NF) for use in PostgreSQL, we determined that our API would be easier to utilize with data in a denormalized state.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">After we created these tables on a local database, we used Heroku to host the database online. In order for Heroku to interface with our database correctly, we used the Heroku Postgres add-on during the creation of our Heroku server. The end result of this process is a production database that can drive the data for our Flask application.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">In order to create an application to generate our API, we used Flask to create our app and our routes (similar to a website directory). Our app has two routes - one containing Missing Migrant data and another containing Border Crossing data.</p>                         
                        <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">Our ORM query was simple - there were no filters applied or other manipuluations done using Python after the tables were hosted on Heroku Postgres.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">At this point, the challenge was to get the tables from Postgres (that was in a tabular format) to be delivered in a JSON format for our API. After the JSON was returned for our migrant incident and port tables, our APIs were ready to be consumed.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">Finally, we hosted this Flask application on Heroku as an app. We did this so our APIs were hosted on the internet and could be easily called by any front-end. This data is ultimately used to generate the charts and maps on our site.</p>

The data is then sorted by the year reported and stored. As the data is assigned to it's respective year layer, a counter is incremented in order to count the number of incidents in each year. These counts are then reported in the display in the bottom-left corner of our Dashboard map.</p>

                      <p class="card-text" id="card-descriptive-text">The process for creating the map on our Southern Border Map page followed a similar format, however, instead of assigning data to a set of layers based on year, we chose to organize the migrant incidents data using marker clusters, in order to easily visualize the volume of migrant incidents in a given region along the US-Mexico border. This map is intended to show all of our data at once, to give a "big picture" perspective to our data, while the map on our dashboard is intended to visualize data in different ways to analyze incidents by year.</p>

              <p id="about-text">As we began plotting each incident from the Missing Migrants Project data, we encountered anomalies in the way the data was plotted (hundreds of incidents shared the same coordinates). Upon further inspection of the affected points, we realized that the data containing these incidents contained placeholder coordinates that masked the true locations of these incidents.</p>
              <br/>
              <p id="about-text">To fix the problem, we sourced data from the humaneborders.info website and matched to the Missing Migrants Project data incidents on incident date, fatality count and cause of death, allowing us to examine these incidents with their original coordinates.</p>

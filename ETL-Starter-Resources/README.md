Week 13 - ETL project

Project:  Missing Migrants Relative to Border Entry

Kaggle Data Sources:	

1.	Border Crossing Entry Data (aka Crossing)
2.	Missing Migrants Project (aka Missing)

The purpose will be to assemble a database that enables analysis of migration patterns and missing migrants.
We will be putting data together to look at migration volume and timing into different U.S. entry points and Missing Migrant instances.  After cleaning the data, we will be able to join on such things as U.S. state and possibly more refined entry points (with the help of lat-lng coordinates which are in both data sources). 


# Our Final Report has been included as markdown at the beginning of our Jupyter Notebook file.

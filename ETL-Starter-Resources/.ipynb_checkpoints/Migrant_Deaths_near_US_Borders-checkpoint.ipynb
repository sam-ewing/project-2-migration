    "### Background\n",
    "The Missing Migrants database contained data regarding the deaths and disappearances of migrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers from around the globe, ranging between January 2014 and March 2019. According to the publisher, the research behind the Missing Migrants project began with a set of tragedies that occurred in October of 2013, when over 350 people lost their lives in two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa. Since it's creation, the Missing Migrants Project has been a major source of data used by the media, researchers and the general public for gaining information in this sector.\n",
    "An important consideration that the documentation of this data set pointed out (that also influenced many of our data-cleaning and refining decisions, as discussed later) is that the data contained in this data set represents estimates, because many deaths that occur during migration are not reported or go unrecorded. For a deeper explanation on how this consideration impacted our data-processing efforts, please see the Transform section below.\n",

    "This section will discuss how we cleaned and transformed our data step-by-step, as well as our reasoning behind why we chose to clean and transform the data in the way we did. Each cell of our Jupyter notebook has been labeled with a cell number, which corresponds to the cell number in this report. Our guideline for the data transformation were that we wanted to create a 3NF SQL database, since the source data was structured.  The primary tables to query on will be an \"incidents\" table containing each reported incident of death and/or missing migrants and a \"crossings\" table containing migrant traffic volume information.  To reduce redundant string values in the columns of each table, and thereby improve storage and query efficiency, we created several supporting lookup (reference) tables.\n",

    "The first thing that occurs in this cell is to fill any NaN values in the Minimum_Estimated_Number_of_Missing_Individuals column. This was done manually by a for-loop that examined the values of the Fatalities and the Total_Dead_and_Missing columns. Where the values of these two columns were equal, the Minimum_Estimated_Number_of_Missing_Individuals was assigned a value of 0, while the original value was maintained where the two columns were not equal.\n",

    "### IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING DATA CLEANING: \n",
    "It's important to note that we chose NOT for fill every NaN value in our data set. We strongly felt that the NaN values were actually necessary to maintain the integrity of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, some incidents contain NaN values for the Number_of_Females, Number_of_Males, and Number_of_Children columns, while a value exists in the Fatalities column. These columns were likely left unpopulated due to the lack of that information in the original source. Because of this, we found it \"untrue\" or \"unfair\" to populate or drop these records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example: There are a small number of incidents with NaN values registered in the Fatalities Column. We associated this with missing persons cases where the individual's body has never been found. Because the person has not been found alive OR dead, we decided to leave those values in their original state, because filling them with a numeric value would be 'untrue' to the original data and the case information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the original data set was created using information from a huge variety of sources, a  lot of the information in the original data set was created using estimates. Keeping in mind that many of the incidents were reported with only partial information, and while investigations into some cases are still underway, we determined it best to leave these parts of the data unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cell 8\n",
    "The main action occurring in this cell is to divide the coordinates from the Location_Coordinates column into individual columns of Incident_Lat and Incident_Lng. This was done by splitting the Location_Coordinates column on it's comma delimiter.\n",
